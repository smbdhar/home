# About ME: 
I currently focus on building numerical models to simulate earthquake-related crustal deformation using GNSS observations and the rheological properties of rock. I recently completed my Ph.D. degree, exploring the heterogeneous mantle rheology of northeastern Japan by analysis of postseismic deformation of the M9 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. I am motivated to develop innovative technologies that can efficiently predict ground deformations in the coming decades or more.
